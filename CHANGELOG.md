# Changelog

All notable changes to the Blacksite VS Code extension are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## 0.4.0

### Added

- **Territory index.** A new Territories section in the Map's control rail lists the biggest
  folder territories with their true canvas colors — click a row to frame that territory,
  or Fold/Open it into a single star, without hunting the canvas for it.
- **Connections navigator.** The node card now lists a selected file's top dependencies and
  dependents (ranked by connectivity) as click-to-navigate rows, so you can walk the import
  graph instead of reading bare degree counts. Neighbors folded into a collapsed cluster
  surface as that cluster.
- **Smarter Map search.** Search now ANDs whitespace-separated terms, falls back to fuzzy
  basename matching ("grapp" finds `GraphApp.tsx`), ranks basename hits above path hits, and
  highlights the matched characters in each result. Hovering a result previews that star on
  the canvas before you commit.
- **Minimap drag-to-pan.** Hold and drag the minimap to sweep the camera continuously
  (click-to-jump still works), and a "you are here" marker shows the focused star in its
  territory color.

### Changed

- **Aggregates look like aggregates.** A collapsed folder's super-node now wears an orbital
  ring and Services-lens nodes a diamond outline, so semantic aggregates are distinguishable
  from big files even at overview zoom. The Map key documents both marks.
- **Color continuity between canvas and chrome.** Search results, the focus tooltip, and the
  selection cards now carry the territory's color swatch, tying the HTML overlays to the
  exact hues the renderer draws.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- **LSP tool cancellation.** `code_*` tools now cancel in-flight language-server calls promptly
  when a turn is cancelled, instead of riding out the full timeout.
- **Actionable "no provider" errors.** Code-intelligence tools that come back empty now explain
  why when a language's recommended extension isn't installed, instead of a generic "no results"
  message.
- **Signature help on hover.** `code_hover` now shows the active parameter of an in-scope call
  signature, bolded, alongside the usual hover text.
- **Safer renames.** `code_rename` validates the position via the language server's own
  `prepareRename` first, surfacing the specific reason a rename can't proceed instead of a
  generic failure.
- **`code_inlay_hints` tool.** Inferred type and parameter-name hints for a file or range — most
  useful for untyped or dynamically-typed code.
- **Background-indexing prompt.** The Codebase Map's onboarding panel now also offers to turn on
  `blacksite.graph.backgroundSymbols` once a working language server is detected, instead of that
  setting being discoverable only via `settings.json`.
- **Saved Map views.** Name and save the current camera position, filters, and collapsed
  clusters, then jump back to it later from the Map toolbar.
- **Semantic zoom.** On a multi-codebase workspace, zooming out past the whole-map fit now
  collapses individual files toward their neighborhood's silhouette instead of rendering every
  star at every zoom level.
- **Cross-project cycle flagging.** A new opt-in "Cycles" layer highlights cross-codebase
  reference cycles detected in project manifests.
- **Cul-de-sac detection.** A new opt-in "Cul-de-sacs" layer dims probably-unused orphan files
  and highlights the single bridge edge into an isolated "pocket" subgraph within a neighborhood.
- **Adaptive architecture routes.** Dense file maps now replace raw overview hairballs with a
  connectivity-preserving, weighted folder backbone and restore file links automatically at
  detail zoom. The control rail discloses both raw corpus size and visible route count.
- **Collision-aware semantic labels.** Territory, module, and subgroup labels use distinct zoom
  bands plus a screen-space collision/occlusion pass, keeping architecture names readable around
  the command panel, inspector, and focused node.
- **Service relationship bundles.** Parallel API, event, data, and config detections render as one
  directed weighted route per service pair and kind while retaining confidence ranges and raw
  evidence in the inspector.
- **Adaptive service topology.** Dense many-to-many service maps now use a weighted,
  connectivity-preserving backbone at overview zoom, then restore every typed route at detail
  zoom or around a focused service. Focused routes carry direction chevrons for fast
  one-to-many / many-to-one reading.
- **Service-aware map navigation.** Search and Follow Agent now project a file path onto its
  visible owning service, rather than leaving an invisible file selection in the Services lens.

### Changed

- The Map's empty-state message now matches the rest of the panel's visual language (heading +
  subtext) instead of a single terse line.
- The Map layout now gives high-degree hubs weaker, longer spokes and collision-separates dense
  service meshes. Existing position caches rebuild once under schema v8.
- Dense Map overviews use restrained node compositing, fewer decorative stars, hidden per-file
  badges, a scrollable progressive-disclosure control rail, semantic focus states, and responsive
  high-contrast/reduced-transparency styling.
- Services now assign nested paths to their most-specific root (with `.` representing the
  workspace root), avoiding double-counted service size and incorrect centroids in monorepos.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- **Docked approval/question bar.** Pending questions and tool approvals now surface in a
  persistent bar pinned above the chat input, visible regardless of where the transcript is
  scrolled — including approvals raised inside subagent lanes, which were previously the most
  buried case (hidden behind both a collapsed lane tile and a collapsed tool-log summary). A
  "show in thread" link jumps to the full context when it's available.
- **Approval prompts for unrecognized shell commands.** A command that is neither explicitly
  allowed nor explicitly denied now prompts for approval instead of failing instantly.
  Explicitly denied commands (`blacksite.permissions.deniedCommands`) still hard-block with no
  prompt. Applies to both one-shot commands (`shell_run`) and long-running processes
  (`process_start`).
- **Project vs. all-projects "always allow."** Choosing "always allow" for a command binary now
  offers an explicit choice between persisting the rule for the current project only or for all
  projects, instead of always auto-detecting the scope.
- **Richer, more editable plans.** Phases and steps can now carry an optional risk note,
  dependency references, acceptance-criteria bullets, and a coarse complexity hint
  (small/medium/large). `plan_update` gained `reorderPhaseIds`, `reorderStepIds`,
  `moveStepId`/`moveStepToPhaseId`, and `insertPhaseBeforeId` for restructuring an existing plan
  without recreating it.

### Changed

- Tool guidance now nudges the agent to build larger plans phase-by-phase via `plan_create` +
  `plan_update`'s `addPhases`, rather than authoring every phase in one call.

### Fixed

- A shell command that isn't on the built-in or configured allowlist no longer fails outright
  with "not in the allowed list" — it now gets a chance to ask.
